## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

I learned how configure my first project in github and also how develop this component in React js. Other learnings were some basics styles in CSS and basic formatting in HTML. However, It was very important for me because this is my first project in this kind of challenges.

### Continued development

I would like to continue developing this challenges using react as main resource and complementing with other ones as HTML5, CSS, SAAS, among others
